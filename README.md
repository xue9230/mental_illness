# DATA 1202
# FINAL PROJECT
#
It is about mental illness
 we want to analyze the frequence and attitude verify by by geographic location
 I try to anayze by countries and states 
# Project
#
Python code for this project call : final version.py

I upoad the final_project(data1202).py first, and update to define the function by using github desktop version, i can see
all the file on the desktop verison, but I cannot see the update from web version, so just in case I upload my final version of my final
project

# why do i choose the variable
#
for frequence
from the data, if we count the number of each country shows in the dataset, i will know which country(or state) most patients
come from

for attitude
i choose the variable "treatment", whether the patients seek to treatment, we can see that if they have positive attitude or negative
attitude for their illness
